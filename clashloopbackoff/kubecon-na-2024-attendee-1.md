Welcome all who like technical challenges and doing silly things. Here is the challenge for you today. 

1. Apply the following manifest to your Kind cluster:
   
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/website/main/content/en/examples/application/deployment.yaml
   
   (TBH JUST ANY EXAMPLE NGINX POD THIS IS MEANT TO BE LIGHTWEIGHT AND EASY)
   
2. You should now have a running test nginx pod. Hooray.

3. ??????

4. `kubectl delete` your pod.

5. First three that send a Slack notification to the `#clashloopbackoff-attendee` Slack channel alerting that their pod was deleted win!

(PS the Slack Webhook: `https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`)
