Competitors will group into teams based on where they're sitting (keep it easy)

This challenge is a PVP challenge, and has two phases: Prepare, then Attack

## PREPARE PHASE ##

Two KUBECONFIGs will be linked in the #clashloopbackoff-attendee channel. They're also part of this Gist.

`team-1.conf` will be Team Right

`team-2.conf` will be Team Left

Each team will have ten minutes to create and secure a secret in the `kube-system` namespace, named `Honk`. 

HONOR SYSTEM PLEASE DO NOT TOUCH THE OPPOSING TEAM'S CLUSTER AT THIS TIME IF YOU DO YOU ARE A BAD PERSON. :P

## ATTACK PHASE ##

Once ten minutes are up, teams will swap KubeConfigs and go on the attack. 

Goal? Simple: Get the value of the secret. First team wins. You have thirty minutes.

Work as a group or individually. Embrace the chaos.
