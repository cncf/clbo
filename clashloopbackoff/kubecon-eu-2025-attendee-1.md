Welcome all who like technical challenges and doing silly things. Here is the challenge for you today. 

1. Create a local cluster on your laptop. Kind, Minikube, K3s, Hard Way, doesn't matter.

2. Give me a way to run a command on your cluster. You may not give me a Kubeconfig. You may not give me physical access to your laptop. 

3. ????

4. First three that ask me to run a command on their cluster, wins. 

Good luck!
