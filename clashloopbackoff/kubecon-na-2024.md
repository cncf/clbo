# ClashLoop: Paris 2024 Edition

## Match One

### Jeremy Rickard vs. Mahamed Ali (Est Start time: 6:30p) 
“Sup Gamers” - Deploy and test a Minecraft server (not self-hosted)
“HonkCTL Scramble” - Public kubeconfig posted 3min before you get access to the cluster, secure it
**“Cattle, not pets” - Spin up three clusters (kind/k3s okay) – Best multi cluster setup wins**

**Winner: Mahamed** 

TBH Jeremy showed up with a fresh install of Windows on his laptop. I think he wanted to lose.

## Match Two

### Mitch Connors vs. Mario Fahlandt (Est Start time: 7:15p) 
“Help! My cluster is broken!” - Fix the cluster fastest
“I needed an AI task” - Create an inference API endpoint that the audience can hit and you can monitor.
**“Project CI is Easy” - Given a repo, set up GitHub ARC and monitor it.**

**Winner: Mitch**

It was a close match but CRDs tripped up Mario and Mitch was able to show an action ran successfully.
